Jojik is the korean word for "organizational." i was going to call this design "organizational matrix" but the korean word for matrix was waaaay to hard to pronounce.

awesome for holding and organizing cables so that you dont have to hunt around in the dark, design is able to be tweaked to make a layout as small as 2x2 or as big as you can print. this file is 8x8, but it can be easily modified to fit any size.

print looks rough, this was a test print, so i had the print speed and resolution on normal settings.
